          A blurb: Hey there--Or perhaps I should say "howdy"? No. Anyway! I hope you like this very, very, very basic website. I put a lot of love into it, and edited it for hours on end. I jumped too quickly into Django/Heroku when I should have first made a site like this. It is WAY too overwhelming when you go from HTML, CSS and Javascript to Django. Just don't do it. <br>
          I hope you also like my game! It's only in the planning stages as of now, but the general concept/story was thought of nearly three years ago now. I hope that doing this 'demo version' will be the motivation to starting the real thing.<br>
          If you like it, please let me know what about it you liked, or maybe you disliked it. Input on why would be helpful too!

              <b>The final version of the game</b><br>
              I hope to either use Renpy (with Python) or GameMaker Studio (with GML) in order to develop it.<br>
              This demo will be much different than the final product, but was fun to make regardless!<br>
