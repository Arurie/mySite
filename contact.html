I put a lot of love into it, and edited it for hours on end. I jumped too quickly into Django/Heroku when I should have first made a site like this. It is WAY too overwhelming when you go from HTML, CSS and Javascript to Django. Just don't do it. <br><br>
            I hope you also like my game! It's only in the planning stages as of now, but the general concept/story was thought of two years ago now. I hope that doing this 'demo version' will be the motivation to starting the real thing.<br>
            I'd really love it if people gave me feedback on what they liked/disliked about it, so that I can implement it in the final version.<br><br>

												<p class="card-text">Two years ago, I had the idea for my business.<br>Plagued by sensitive skin, and products claiming the universal solution through branding their products as 'for sensitive skin' consumed a lot of money, and was downright infuriating.<br>I seek to simplify the process through community validation, and various technological frameworks I'm still afraid to speak too publicly about.<br>In January 2018, I even won a pitch competiton for a small amount of funding towards my idea.<br></p>

												<p class="card-text">The main thing I've learned from talking to people about my business idea is that they want a sense of community, ease of use, and a feeling of welcomeness.<br>That's just what this little guy/girl was created for!<br>They will offer users interface help, and can even redirect them to videos if they so prefer.<br>They may even be customizable down the line, or have various incarnations due to localization concerns, but for now, they're a circus dog slug!</p>

												<p class="card-text">The full game will not be browser-based, but will instead utilize Game Maker 2. This means that there will be gameplay, images, and music!<br>The mechanics will be a mix of top-down RPG exploration interspersed with visual novel sections to highlight social interactions.<br>Importance will be placed on when and where you interact with someone.</p>
