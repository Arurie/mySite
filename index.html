						On an endless night, in a shut-off world, with 		the few who remain, your journey begins.<br>
						You assume the identity of a nameless rat, the lowest a creature's existence can be. <br>
						Explore what little is left, and meet a colorful cast who may not all be as they appear.<br>
						The 'battle system' is comprised of communication. <br>
						If you're familiar with visual novels or text adventures, that is the basic style this demo will be.<br>
						This style was chosen because of both its simplicity for a short-term development, and how choosing how to communicate with others being a key component in the themes presented.<br>
						Basically, communicating is difficult for a lot of people, and we aren't always able to see eye-to-eye. <br>
						Do your best to understand others, and make your thoughts transparent!

							The inspiration for this game came from a year abroad, and the difficulties that brings. New places and dynamics are integral for gaining new perspectives and empathy, but some are better equipped to handle such situations than others. This game is an exploration in navigating difficult social situations, where views differ and each party is equipped with their own memories, previous biases, reality filters, and baseline of understanding for any given situation.
